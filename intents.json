Think of it like Earth wearing too many blankets! The main culprits are cars, factories, and cutting down forests.",
        "Climate change is when our planet gets hotter and the weather gets all messed up. It's happening because we're putting too much CO2 and other gases into the air. This causes crazy weather, melting ice, and rising sea levels. We can fix it by using clean energy and being smarter about how we live!",

It's causing floods, droughts, and all kinds of problems. But the good news? We can totally do something about it!",
